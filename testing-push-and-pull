I just pushed new files to github that are not yet on my local branch. I am creating this file to test and ensure that doing a pull from Windows after committing this file will merge what is on the net with my local.

This first part of this file was created usiing cat > FileName in git-bash.
This part is edited in vim.
The purpose is test for that lf crlf message I was getting earlier.
