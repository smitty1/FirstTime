# FirstTime
First attempt at git hub
For Right now only interested in getting other peoples work. I am studyng up on scripting with bash and python, but not ready to use them yet.
2015-07-19 Installed git on Windows desktop, and cloned my 3 repos. I can now work on the Desktop computer and  on the laptop in Linux Mint Mate.
Moved my FirstTime repo on Linux Mint to ~/home/jim/Documents/DataScientist_toolbox/github-repo/FirstTime
