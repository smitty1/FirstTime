# FirstTime
First attempt at git hub
For Right now only interested in getting other peoples work. I am studyng up on scripting with bash and python, but not ready to use them yet.
2016-06-20 Installed git on Windows desktop, and the Windows partition on the Toshiba laptop. I can now work on the Desktop computer and on the laptop in SolydX. 
I Created a folder for git repositories in ~/Playground/Git, and cloned my FirstTime repo from https://github.com/smitty1/FirstTime. Everything smoth so far.
