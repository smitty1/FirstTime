Had to restore the  harddrive from the June 9 Clone of the full hdd.
This was pre working on git 
Setup Directory ~/Playground/git
git clone https://github.com/smitty1/FirstTime
cd ~/Playground/git/FirstTime
$git status
On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
nothing to commit, working directory clean

Now I will put this file through thee git process to make sureI still have it right.
