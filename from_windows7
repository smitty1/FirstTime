This is my first attempt to add a file to git/git hub from my desktop  machine running Windows 7 Home.
This sentence was added using vi from Windows. Apparently it is the default core.editor here. I need to find a way to change that to notepad++.

I tried entering "git ocnfig --global core.editor nano". There were no errors and "git config --list" shows the entry but it had no effect, this is again being entered in vi.

I tried to set notepad++ as the editor using the comlete path
git config --global core.editor /C/Program\ File\ \(x86\)/Notepad++/notepad++.exe
It was accepted
core.editor=c:/Program File (x86)/Notepad++/notepad++.exe
But when I ran "git commit " It returned an error as before. So I will have to live with vim to Insert the commit messages.
